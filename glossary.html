<h1>Glossary</h1>
<p>Terminology as used in the project.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Platform Firmware</h2>
<p>The <em>Platform Firmware</em> is a generic term used to describe the first thing
the CPU starts at boot time. On your typical <code>x86_64</code> system, it would be what
was previously called the <em>BIOS</em>. Now often diminutively called by the name
<em>EFI</em>. This is what initializes enough of the hardware so that the <em>operating
system</em> can start. Additionally, it often provides facilities for the user to
do basic configuration, and manage boot options.</p>
<p>In the ARM with SBCs landscape, <strong>U-Boot</strong> is the de facto solution for the
<em>Platform Firmware</em>. Though <em>U-Boot</em> is confusingly, but rightly, often
referred to as a <em>Boot Loader</em>. <em>U-Boot</em> plays double duties often. It is
tasked with <em>initializing the hardware</em>, and often also used to handle <em>loading
and booting</em> the operating system.</p>
<h2>Boot Loader</h2>
<p>The <em>Boot loader</em> is a program which may or may not be distinct from the
<em>Platform Firmware</em>, which is meant to load and boot an <em>Operating System</em>.</p>
<p><em>Boot loaders</em> are now commonly written following the <em>UEFI</em> spec. <em>GRUB</em>,
<em>rEFInd</em> and <em>systemd-boot</em> are examples of UEFI <em>boot loaders</em>.</p>
<h2>Dedicated storage</h2>
<p><strong>Dedicated storage</strong> is used when the <em>Tow-Boot</em> installation lives on a
location where it is not expected the target booted system would live.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, an SPI flash chip <strong>is</strong> <em>dedicated storage</em>.</p>
<p>A built-in eMMC, even if small, would be considered <em>shared storage</em>. Note that
the eMMC may have <em>hardware boot partitions</em>, these are considered <em>dedicated
storage</em>, but may not be usable on all platforms.</p>
<h2>Shared storage</h2>
<p><strong>Shared storage</strong> is used when the <em>Tow-Boot</em> installation lives on the same
storage as the booted system.</p>
<p>While technically some say it wouldn't be <em>shared storage</em>, if the storage
where <em>Tow-Boot</em> is installed is also a bootable target, it is <em>shared storage</em>.
Even if the actually booted system lives entirely on another storage.</p>
<p>E.g. on a <em>Raspberry Pi</em>, reserving the whole SD card for the FAT32 partition
for the <em>Raspberry Pi</em> firmware files and for the <em>Tow-Boot</em> install, and
booting a GPT-formatted USB drive, <em>Tow-Boot</em> is considered to be installed as
<strong>shared storage</strong>.</p>
